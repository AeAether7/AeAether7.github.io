		  > Drone reconnaissance is the backbone of combined arms operations. You have been granted authorization to deploy the latest models of recon drones. These drones are battery-powered but can be easily recharged when not in use. Deploy either a *Light Recon Drone*, *Heavy Recon Drone*, or *Microdrone Swarm*. On any one of your turns, you may forgo your turn to instead direct your drone to attack, if it possesses a weapon to attack with. Your drone is an extension of your sensor suite for all targeting and observation purposes.

		- **Light Recon Drone**
		- HP: 15
		  
		  > Light reconnaissance drones are unarmed, fast, stealthy drones intended for field observation.
		- Perks:
		  *Optical Camouflage*: The drone is invisible, and inaudible outside of close ranges. When undetected, it cannot be attacked.
		- Abilities: None
		  ---
		- **Heavy Recon Drone**
		- HP: 65
		  
		  > Heavy reconnaissance drones are lightly armed, lightly armored, large drones intended for long-distance observation, fire support, and cargo hauling.
		- Perks:
		  *Liftoff*: Securely attached cargo (or an android) may be lifted off the ground and rapidly redeployed by this drone.
		- Abilities:
		  *Fire Support*: Fire off a barrage of bullets, making an attack roll against one target. No modifiers.
		- ---
		- **Microdrone Swarm**
		- HP: 40
		  
		  > A swarm of microdrones. Unarmed and low-range. Hard to control, but capable of spreading over an entire area.
		- Perks:
		  *Swarm*: When properly deployed, the swarm can take no more than 10 damage per attack.
		- Abilities: None
	- [**Combat Barrier**]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Requirements: Level 1
		- Time: 1 turn
		- Energy: None
		  
		  > When under heavy suppression, what's needed is rapidly deployable armor. But where androids excel, small arms combat, urban warfare, and stealth operations, heavy armored vehicles like tanks are unusable. That's where deployable combat barricades come in. These heavily armored low walls can be quickly expanded to provide armored cover.
		  
		  Deploy a heavy, armored barricade. Add 10 to all block rolls while behind the barricade. This ability can be upgraded with advanced energetic reactive armor, adding an additional 5. However, the upgraded version consumes 1 energy every time something hits it. You can retrieve the barricade by expending a turn collapsing it. The barricade cannot be moved once deployed.
