- Requirements: [[Spraycan]]
- > The user uses their spray can to place a decal on the back of one of their allies, giving them a personal buff.
  "Don't tell Judy, but one time I drew a penis on the back of his jacket. Had Rin and me in stitches for a good week, watching that bloke try to act all cool with a dick on his back."
- The Vandal gets to choose which buff their ally receives, which can be one of the following:
	- All attack rolls have a [1d8] added to the final roll.
	- Adds a [1d4] to all block rolls
	- Increases energy recharge rate by 1/turn
