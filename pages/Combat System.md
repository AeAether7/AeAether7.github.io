- Combat in Nebu is broken down into two states. The attacking state, and the defending state. For the sake of the explanation, I will be describing a 2v2 battle between 4 NPCS while explaining the combat system. To keep it simple, all 4 NPCS will have 100 health and no perks or stat point bonuses.
- ## Part 1: Action Values
  collapsed:: true
	- To start the battle, all 4 NPCS roll for their action values. The default roll for this value is a 1d20, but this can be altered by either perks or status effects. For simplicity sake, I will be using the default value for all 4 NPCS
	- Hero 1 rolled 16
	  Hero 2 rolled 8
	  Villain 1 rolled a 19
	  Villain 2 rolled a 3
	- The Hero team rolled an average of 12 while the villain team rolled an average of 11, so even though Villain 1 rolled higher then both of the hero NPCS, The hero team gets to take the first action.
	- This step is only done once per combat encounter!
- ## Part 2: Attacking State
  collapsed:: true
	- Since the hero team rolled a higher average action value then the villain team, they are the first to enter the attacking state. While in the attacking state, the hero team can choose to use any of their abilities to freely attack the villain team. Since Hero 1 rolled above the average value for the hero team, they get to choose 2 skills to use, while Hero 2 only gets to use a single skill.
	- Hero 1 uses Justice Slash and does 8 damage to Villain 1!
	  Hero 1 uses Energy Wave and does 18 damage to Villain 2!
	  Hero 2 uses Beretta 92 and does 15 damage to Villain 2!
	- In an actual encounter, the villain team would get to roll for their own defensive actions, but I got lazy :p
- ## Part 3: Applying Status
	- After the hero team used their attacks, it is now time to apply status effects. As players, you all don't need to worry about this since the DM will handle this part for you, but knowing how to apply status effects can be very beneficial, so make sure you read up and know how to kill the enemy better!
	- Villain 1 is inflicted with Bleeding(1)
	  Villain 2 is inflicted with Bleeding(3)
- ## Part 4: Defending State
  collapsed:: true
	- Now it is the villains turn to attack. After the villain team chooses which attacks to use, the hero team can decide how they want to attempt to defend from the attacks.
	- Villain 1 is using Evil Drain with a roll of 16 aimed at Hero 1
	  Villain 1 is using Wicked Blow with a roll of 12 aimed at Hero 2
	  Villain 2 is using Cinderblock with a roll of 6 aimed at Hero 2
	- Since there is only one attack aimed at Hero 1, the option for them is simple, and they choose to block the attack. However, its a little more complicated for Hero 2. Since there are two attacks aimed at Hero 2, they have to choose to take the damage of one of them since they cannot block or evade two attacks at once. In this case, Hero 2 chooses to block Wicked Blow and take the damage from Cinderblock.
	- Hero 1 rolls a 12 and takes 4 damage
	  Hero 2 rolls a 16 and takes 1 damage + 6 from Cinderblock
	- Now that the defending state has ended, status effects are applied to the Hero team. Since Hero 2 took more then 5% of their HP as blunt damage from Cinderblock, they are inflicted with Dazed.
	- Hero 2 is inflicted with Dazed(1)
- ## Part 5: Turn End
  collapsed:: true
	- Now that both teams have taken their attacks, the turn ends. Any status effects are procced here, and all regen effects are applied. Regen effects and positive status effects take priority over negative status effects
	- Hero 1 heals 5 HP (96->100)
	  Hero 2 heals 5 HP (93->98)
	  [Dazed] Hero 2 loses 2 AV (8->6)
	  Villain 1 heals 5 HP (92->97)
	  [Bleeding] Villain 1 loses 1 HP (97->96)
	  Villain 2 heals 5 HP (67->72)
	  [Bleeding] Villain 2 loses 3 HP (72->69)
	- Now that the turn has ended, the cycle repeats!
