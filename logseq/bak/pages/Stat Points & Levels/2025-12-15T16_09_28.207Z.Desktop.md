## Levels
- Throughout the course of this RP, you all will end up leveling up. Starting from level one, I plan on getting you all to level twenty as things progress along. Each level, you get 10 stat points to invest however you see fit!
- ## Stat Points
- Stat points, along with specializations, are how you will refine your character throughout the course of the story. There is no cap to the number of points you can put in a single stat, so you could just put everything into a single stat if you wanted.
- There are four main stats that can be invested into, which are as follows:
- [[Strength]]
- [[Durability]]
- [[Agility]]
- [[Energy]]
